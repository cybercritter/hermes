## Welcome to my little notebook project.
This notebook project, called hermes,  will allow for people to record their journey. <br/>
Everyone's journey is different but have similar experiences. This application will help in documenting <br/>
each journey by being able to pull from others experiences; thus not feel alone. <br>

The hope is by connecting people with the same experiences; we can bridge the gap and reduce the <br>
appalling suicide rate amongst the non-binary and trans communities. Especially with young people.<br>

## For the Nerds, like me, out there
### Here are some of the more specific details

This project will use the following technologies.
1) [mariadb](https://mariadb.org) &mdash; SQL backend for data warehousing. 
   * Before you go crazy and scream a nosql database will work much better; can you say mongodb with a <br>
   straight face? While a nosql database is certainly interesting, I have a fondness for sql databases.<br>
   I am open to constructive discussion.<b>Let me emphasize, I will not get into a religious discussion on this matter!
   </b>
2) [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org) front end &mdash; I do not have <em><b>any</b></em> experience with
 UI/UX design. I am an engineer by trade <br> and my GUI's certainly reflect this deficiency.
If you want to help, Please email me at
[cybercritter@mac.com](mailto:cybercritter@mac.com?subject=[GitHub]%20notebook%20project) 
3) [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) &mdash; I use CLion as my IDE for all my C++ projects. 
I have included the project files as part of this repo.

As I use more 3rd party stuff, this list will be updated.

Thank you for going with me on this journey. <br>
